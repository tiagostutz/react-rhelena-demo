To start your React project with this boilerplate:

* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/tiagostutz/rhelena.git`.
* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install`.
* Start with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm run start`.
* Open your browser on: `http://localhost:3000`

*Last tip: I am using the ATOM editor with Seti UI Theme, that changes the icons of the files based on their type and One Dark Syntax Theme*
